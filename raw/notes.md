# Notes

## Data:

> We collected lexical data from published sources and from fieldwork for 409 Bantu and 15 Bantoid languages. Our wordlist is a modified version of the Atlas Linguistique du GABon (52). This list comprises 159 words from which we have sampled 100 words that are the best documented for the languages we studied (Materials and Methods and SI Materials and Methods). We then classified the words into cognate sets and built a binary- coded dataset (each column identifies a unique cognate class), yielding 3,859 cognate classes for the 424 languages.

## Methods:

* bayesphylogenies, covarion, relaxed
